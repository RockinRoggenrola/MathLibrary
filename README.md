# MathLibrary

# The purpose for this repository is to serve as a JavaScript library which contains robust meth-related functions and utilities. This uses node.js.

# How it Works

# Within MathLibrary/index.js, a math object is exported. This is where all the functionality comes from. All the properties and methods can be accessed from this object.
# To do so, you just have to download this repository to wherever you want to use it in. Then, in the file(s) you will use the repository in, just import the file with the math object and name it any identifier you would like. That is all you have to do to set this up!
